"hide warning slice vs copy df"

test points:
- "i don't have any" - when asked for extra preference, should negate/deny
- nope, nah, weird - weird negation stuff, should negate/deny
- "on welcome, 'i would love to get some italian today'", classified as request, maybe add request into labels that give information?
- "yes" on "cheap italian north" got me a goodbye message

- "i would like any restaurant, any price anywhere in town"
- "anywhere is fine"
- "on specific states, any is related to the current state?"

- "any food but chinese":
