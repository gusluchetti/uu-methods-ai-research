# uu-methods-ai-research
This repo contains the assignments made for the Methods in A.I. Research Course, Utrecht University, 1st Period.

## Build Dependencies
- This project assumes that you have the required packages, or your python environment has all the conda packages. We're working on a better environment-agnostic solution so you don't have to mess your existing environment.
## Notes
- Two arguments are supported when running `main.py`: `reprocess`, which forces the program to rebuild and reprocess the dataframe from the original dataset (dialog_acts.dat) and `remodel`, which forces the remodelling of the current models selected.

### Deadlines:

- 1a. Text Classification - Sept 16th

- 1b. Dialog Management - Sept 23th

- 1c. Reasoning and Configurability - Sept 30th

- **1d. Final Submission - October 9th**
